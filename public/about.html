<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I’m Muhammad Umair, a web developer with a passion for creating engaging and functional websites. My journey into the world of coding started with a fascination for how things work on the web, and that curiosity quickly evolved into a career.</p>

<p>  I enjoy both front-end and back-end development, always striving to make sites that are not just visually appealing but also seamless in their functionality. I love staying up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies, as it helps me bring fresh ideas to my projects. Whether it’s working on a solo project or with a team, I’m always committed to delivering my best work.</p>
